Evaluation Scores for Chosen Solution:
Overallocation Penalty: 4
Conflicts Penalty: 0
Undersupport Penalty: 1
Unwilling Penalty: 2
Unpreferred Penalty: 0

I chose this solution because it strikes a good balance between meeting the needs of each section and respecting
the preferences of the TAs. By assigning TAs to sections they prefer or are at least willing to take, it reduces the
number of assignments that TAs might be unhappy with, which helps keep unwilling and unpreferred penalties low.
Every section gets enough TAs to meet the minimum support needed, so we avoid any undersupport issues.
Overall, this solution effectively meets the scheduling requirements without creating too many conflicts,
making it a solid choice with minimal tradeoffs.
