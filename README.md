Northeastern University’s Khoury College offers several large classes supported by dozens of teaching assistants (TAs). These include Intro to Programming with Data, Discrete Structures, and Fundies. These courses have many lab practicums that need to be supported by the course TAs. Allocating TAs to labs is adifficultbutinterestingresource-allocationchallenge. Whileasimplesign-upsheetmightbea solution, the results are often sub-optimal. In general, our goal is to assign TAs to labs that are consistent with their availability and preferences while making sure we assign enough TAs to each lab. Performing this scheduling task by hand takes many hours of the instructor’s time and it is unlikely that they are coming up with the best possible solution. Solving this problem would be a great service to Khoury college. In this homework assignment we take on the challenge! (Creating a web-based application to make this software more widely available would make for an excellent project, by the way.)
